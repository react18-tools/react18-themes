This is a template created based on official starter Turborepo.

> A quick tip: Delete all stale branches `git branch --merged main | grep -v '^[ *]*main$' | xargs git branch -d`

Simply click on `Use this template` button to use and customize this template for your next JavaSctipt / TypeScript / React / Vue / Next.js library or project.

## What's different from scaffolding turbo-repo by `create-turbo`

The default scafold from `create-turbo` just gives some stubs for sharing packages across projects/apps within current monorepo.

This template is targeted for sharing packages across organizations/repos publically or privately.

Following features make it really cool and useful

- Unit tests with `vitest`
- Build setup with `tsup` and `esbuild-react18-useclient` Supports React Server components out of the box
- **Automatic file generation**
  - just run `yarn turbo gen` and follow the propts to auto generate your new component with test file and dependency linking
  - follow best practices automatically
- As a small extra gift Fork Me component is already added in UI
- github actions/workflows to auto publish your package when version changes

## What's inside?

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Apps and Packages

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

- `nextjs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `docs`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `ui`: a React component library shared by both `nextjs` and `docs` examples
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/example is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
