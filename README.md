ðŸ¤Ÿ ðŸ‘‰ [Unleash the Power of React Server Components](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/unleash-the-power-of-react-server-components-eb3fe7201231)

This project is inspired by `next-themes`. `next-themes` is an awesome package, however, it requires wrapping everything in a client side provider. And thus, it takes away all the benefits of Server Components.

`react18-themes` removes this limitation and enables you to unleash the full power of React 18 Server Components. In addition, more features are coming up soon... Stay tuned!

- âœ… Fully Treeshakable (`import from react18-themes/client/component`)
- âœ… Full TypeScript Support
- âœ… Unleash the full power of React18 Server components
- âœ… Works with all build systems/tools/frameworks for React18
- âœ… Perfect dark mode in 2 lines of code
- âœ… System setting with prefers-color-scheme
- âœ… Themed browser UI with color-scheme
- âœ… Support for Next.js 13 `appDir`
- âœ… Sync theme across tabs and windows
- âœ… Theme in sync with server component
- âœ… Disable flashing when changing themes
- âœ… Force pages to specific themes
- âœ… Class or data attribute selector
- âœ… Manipulate theme via `useTheme` hook

Check out the [live example](https://react18-themes.vercel.app/).

## Use

### With pages/

The best way is to add a [Custom `App`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app) to use by modifying `_app` as follows:

Adding dark mode support takes 2 lines of code:

```js
import { ThemeSwitcher } from "react18-themes";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
	return (
		<>
			<ThemeSwitcher forcedTheme={Component.theme} />
			<Component {...pageProps} />
		</>
	);
}

export default MyApp;
```

âš¡ðŸŽ‰Boom! Just a couple of lines and your dark mode is ready!

Check out examples for advanced usage.

### With app/

Update your `app/layout.jsx` to add `ThemeSwitcher` and `ServerSideWrapper` from `react18-themes`. `ServerSideWrapper` is required to avoid flash of un-themed content on reload.

```js
// app/layout.jsx
import { ThemeSwitcher } from "react18-themes";
import { ServerSideWrapper } from "react18-themes/server/nextjs";

export default function Layout({ children }) {
	return (
		<ServerSideWrapper tag="html" lang="en">
			<head />
			<body>
				<ThemeSwitcher />
				{children}
			</body>
		</ServerSideWrapper>
	);
}
```

Woohoo! You just added dark mode and you can also use Server Component! Isn't that awesome!

### HTML & CSS

That's it, your Next.js app fully supports dark mode, including System preference with `prefers-color-scheme`. The theme is also immediately synced between tabs. By default, react18-themes modifies the `data-theme` attribute on the `html` element, which you can easily use to style your app:

```css
:root {
	/* Your default theme */
	--background: white;
	--foreground: black;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
	--background: black;
	--foreground: white;
}
```

### useTheme

In case your components need to know the current theme and be able to change it. The `useTheme` hook provides theme information:

```js
import { useTheme } from "react18-themes";

const ThemeChanger = () => {
	/* you can also improve performance by using selectors
	 * const [theme, setTheme] = useTheme(state => [state.theme, state.setTheme]);
	 */
	const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();

	return (
		<div>
			The current theme is: {theme}
			<button onClick={() => setTheme("light")}>Light Mode</button>
			<button onClick={() => setTheme("dark")}>Dark Mode</button>
		</div>
	);
};
```

## Force per page theme and color-scheme

### Next.js app router

```javascript
import { ForceTheme } from "react18-themes";

function MyPage() {
	return (
		<>
			<ForceTheme theme={"my-theme"} />
			...
		</>
	);
}

export default MyPage;
```

### Next.js pages router

For pages router, you have 2 options. One is the same as the app router and the other option which is compatible with `next-themes` is to add `theme` to your page component as follows.

```javascript
function MyPage() {
	return <>...</>;
}

MyPage.theme = "my-theme";

export default MyPage;
```

In a similar way, you can also force color scheme.

Forcing color scheme will apply your defaultDark or defaultLight theme, configurable via hooks.

## Migrating from v0 to v1

- defaultDarkTheme is renamed to darkTheme
- setDefaultDarkTheme is renamed to setDarkTheme
- defaultLightTheme is renamed to lightTheme
- setDefaultLightTheme is renamed to setLightTheme
